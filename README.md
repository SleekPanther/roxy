#[Merrill's Roxy Cinema (movie theater database website)](https://npatullo.w3.uvm.edu/cs148/roxy/index.php)

##Notes
- I use PHP to upload image files straight to a server. With a develop & live copy of the site, the images **must be added (committed) to git from the live site** (or already be on develop). Otherwise making changes to develop & pulling to live will remove any new images or changes from the live site.
- I didn't implement the `$databaseSuccess` validation for php mysql forms on the admin `edit.php` and `index.php` pages in the `magic/` folder. I felt it wasn't really needed.
